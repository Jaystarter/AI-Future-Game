# Task ID: 7
# Title: NOW (2025) Workplace Environment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the workplace environment for the 2025 time period with all specified interactions and AI behaviors.
# Details:
Create the workplace environment for 2025 with all interactive elements mentioned in the PRD:

1. Email system with AI-generated rewriting options
2. Calendar for manual meeting scheduling
3. Terminal with basic spellcheck tool
4. Slack-like chat system with random notifications
5. Dashboard with static charts
6. Résumé sorting system with keyword highlighting
7. Spreadsheet for manual data entry
8. Code terminal with simple next-line suggestions
9. Whiteboard for manual drawing
10. NPC boss for requesting time off

Each interactive element should implement the IInteractable interface and provide appropriate responses. The environment should reflect the limited AI capabilities in workplace settings circa 2025.

Implement appropriate visual design that conveys a contemporary office with basic productivity tools but limited AI integration.

# Test Strategy:
Test each interactive element individually to ensure it functions as described in the PRD. Verify that interactions feel appropriate for the 2025 time period. Test the complete environment with a player walking through and interacting with all elements in sequence. Gather feedback on whether the environment successfully conveys the intended level of AI advancement in workplace settings.
