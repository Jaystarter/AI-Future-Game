# Task ID: 4
# Title: Player Character Controller
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a character controller for the player to navigate and interact with the environment in each time period and location.
# Details:
Create a PlayerController class that handles player movement, camera control, and basic interactions. The controller should:

- Support first-person or third-person movement depending on design choice
- Handle collision detection with the environment
- Provide an interaction system to interact with objects and AI entities
- Adapt to different movement capabilities in different time periods (e.g., neural interfaces in far future)

Implementation should include:
```
class PlayerController {
  private Transform playerTransform;
  private Camera playerCamera;
  private CharacterController characterController; // If using Unity
  private InteractionSystem interactionSystem;
  
  public void Initialize();
  public void Move(Vector3 direction);
  public void RotateCamera(Vector2 rotation);
  public void Interact();
  public void UpdateMovementCapabilities(TimePeriod period);
}
```

Ensure the controller feels responsive and intuitive across all time periods.

# Test Strategy:
Test player movement in various environments to ensure smooth navigation. Verify collision detection works correctly with different objects. Test interaction system with various interactable objects. Create a test scene with obstacles and interaction points to verify all functionality.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Basic 2D Movement with SVG Transformations [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core movement system for the player character using SVG transformations to handle position and orientation changes.
### Details:
Implement keyboard/touch input handling, translate inputs to movement vectors, apply SVG transform attributes for character positioning, implement smooth movement with appropriate acceleration/deceleration, and create a movement speed configuration system.

## 2. Develop Collision Detection with SVG Environment Elements [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create a collision detection system that prevents the player from moving through defined boundaries in the SVG environment.
### Details:
Implement bounding box calculations for the player character, detect intersections with environment SVG elements, create collision response that prevents boundary crossing, optimize collision checks for performance, and implement debug visualization for collision boundaries.

## 3. Define Character Interaction Points [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create a system for defining and managing interaction points on the player character that can trigger interactions with the environment.
### Details:
Define interaction point coordinates relative to the character, implement a system to update interaction point positions as the character moves, create methods to check for proximity to interactive elements, and develop a visual indicator for available interactions.

## 4. Implement Player State Management System [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Create a state machine to manage different player states such as idle, walking, and interacting.
### Details:
Define state interfaces and transitions, implement state-specific behavior for idle and walking states, create state transition animations, handle input differently based on current state, and ensure smooth transitions between states.

## 5. Create Animation Controller Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 4.4
### Description: Integrate the player controller with an animation system to display appropriate visual feedback based on movement and state.
### Details:
Map player states to animation triggers, implement sprite or SVG animation changes based on movement direction, create smooth transitions between animations, optimize animation performance for SVG elements, and implement a system for custom animation events.
