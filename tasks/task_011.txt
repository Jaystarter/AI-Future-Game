# Task ID: 11
# Title: MID FUTURE (2040) Workplace Environment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the workplace environment for the 2040 time period with all specified interactions and highly advanced AI behaviors.
# Details:
Create the workplace environment for 2040 with all interactive elements mentioned in the PRD:

1. AI co-creator panel for design generation
2. AI coworker for task collaboration
3. Advanced AI terminal with prompt engineering
4. VR pod for virtual workspace teleportation
5. Dynamic AI task management system
6. Biometric face scanning security
7. AI mentor NPC for career guidance
8. Gamified productivity stats dashboard
9. UBI kiosk with work options
10. AI learning assistance system

Each interactive element should implement the IInteractable interface and provide appropriate responses. The environment should reflect the highly advanced AI capabilities in workplace settings circa 2040, with systems that augment human creativity and productivity.

Implement appropriate visual design that conveys a mid-future workplace with extensive AI integration, virtual environments, and human-AI collaboration.

# Test Strategy:
Test each interactive element individually to ensure it functions as described in the PRD. Verify that interactions feel appropriately advanced for the 2040 time period. Test the complete environment with a player walking through and interacting with all elements in sequence. Compare with earlier workplace environments to ensure a clear progression in AI capabilities is evident.
