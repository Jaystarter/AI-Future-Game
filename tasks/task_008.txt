# Task ID: 8
# Title: NEAR FUTURE (2030) Home Environment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the home environment for the 2030 time period with all specified interactions and advanced AI behaviors.
# Details:
Create the home environment for 2030 with all interactive elements mentioned in the PRD:

1. Smart screen with AI cooking recipes
2. Smart lighting/sound system that responds to waking
3. AI tutor screen for math problems
4. Smart mirror displaying weather, schedule, and tasks
5. Robot arm for food preparation
6. AI-powered chore board for family task distribution
7. Smart fridge with recipe suggestions
8. Self-driving car
9. AR glasses for interactive games
10. Tablet with personal AI dashboard

Each interactive element should implement the IInteractable interface and provide appropriate responses. The environment should reflect the advanced AI capabilities of 2030 compared to 2025, with more proactive and integrated systems.

Implement appropriate visual design that conveys a near-future home with significant AI integration and automation.

# Test Strategy:
Test each interactive element individually to ensure it functions as described in the PRD. Verify that interactions feel appropriately advanced for the 2030 time period. Test the complete environment with a player walking through and interacting with all elements in sequence. Compare with the 2025 environment to ensure a clear progression in AI capabilities is evident.
