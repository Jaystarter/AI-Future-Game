# Task ID: 15
# Title: AI Behavior System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a system to manage AI entity behaviors and responses across different time periods.
# Details:
Create an AIBehaviorSystem that manages the behaviors and responses of AI entities in the game. This system should:

- Define behavior patterns for different AI types (assistants, robots, companions)
- Scale intelligence and capabilities based on the time period
- Handle interactions with the player
- Simulate learning and adaptation where appropriate

Implementation should include:
```
interface IAIEntity {
  void Initialize(TimePeriod period);
  void ProcessInput(string input);
  void UpdateBehavior();
  void Interact(PlayerController player);
  void UpdateCapabilities(TimePeriod period);
}

class AIBehaviorSystem {
  private Dictionary<string, IAIEntity> aiEntities;
  private TimePeriod currentPeriod;
  
  public void Initialize(TimePeriod period);
  public void RegisterAI(string id, IAIEntity entity);
  public IAIEntity GetAI(string id);
  public void UpdateAllAI();
  public void UpdatePeriod(TimePeriod period);
}
```

Implement specific AI types with behaviors that evolve across time periods:
- Basic assistants (2025): Rule-based responses to specific commands
- Smart assistants (2030): Context-aware, proactive suggestions
- Emotional companions (2040): Empathetic responses, relationship building
- Sentient partners (2055-2100): Autonomous decision-making, philosophical discussions

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for each AI type to verify behavior patterns. Test interactions with the player across different scenarios. Verify that AI capabilities appropriately evolve across time periods. Test edge cases like conflicting commands or unusual player behavior.
