# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project Setup and Architecture Design
# Status: deferred
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository and design the overall architecture for the AI Future Timeline Simulation Game.
# Details:
Create a new repository with appropriate structure for a simulation game with four distinct time periods (2025, 2030, 2040, 2055-2100). Design a modular architecture that allows for easy addition of scenes, interactions, and AI behaviors across different time periods. Consider using a game engine like Unity or Unreal for 3D visualization or a web-based framework for broader accessibility. The architecture should support:

- Scene management for different time periods and locations (home/workplace)
- Character controller for player movement and interaction
- Interaction system for AI and environment objects
- State management to track progress and unlocked features
- UI system for displaying information and controls

Folder structure should include:
- /Assets (or /src)
  - /Scenes
  - /Scripts
  - /Models
  - /UI
  - /Audio
  - /Prefabs (or /Components)
- /Documentation
- /Tests

# Test Strategy:
Verify project structure is complete and follows best practices. Test that the architecture can support all required features by creating simple prototypes for each major system. Review with team members to ensure the design meets all requirements from the PRD.
