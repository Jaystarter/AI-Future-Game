# Task ID: 12
# Title: FAR FUTURE (2055-2100) Home Environment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the home environment for the 2055-2100 time period with all specified interactions and futuristic AI behaviors.
# Details:
Create the home environment for 2055-2100 with all interactive elements mentioned in the PRD:

1. Neural interface tile for mood-based environments
2. AI partner with persistent memory
3. Matter-manipulating wall panel for room redesign
4. Mood-based food printer
5. Holographic family reconstruction booth
6. Direct neural skill upload console
7. Time perception adjustment system
8. Immersive vacation simulation portal
9. Memory editing console
10. Ethical decision voting hub

Each interactive element should implement the IInteractable interface and provide appropriate responses. The environment should reflect the futuristic AI capabilities of 2055-2100, with systems that directly interface with human cognition and manipulate physical reality.

Implement appropriate visual design that conveys a far-future home with transformative AI integration, neural interfaces, and reality-altering capabilities.

# Test Strategy:
Test each interactive element individually to ensure it functions as described in the PRD. Verify that interactions feel appropriately advanced for the 2055-2100 time period. Test the complete environment with a player walking through and interacting with all elements in sequence. Compare with earlier time periods to ensure a clear progression to transformative AI capabilities is evident.
