# Task ID: 27
# Title: Implement Home Environment Interactions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 26
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the home environment with all interactive elements for each time period, including appliances, furniture, and AI-enabled devices that evolve across time periods.
# Details:
Design and implement the home environment with interactive elements that change across time periods. Create a component system for interactive objects with different behaviors based on the time period.

```typescript
class InteractiveObject {
  id: string;
  timePeriodBehaviors: Map<string, () => void>;
  
  constructor(id: string) {
    this.id = id;
    this.timePeriodBehaviors = new Map();
  }
  
  
  interact(timePeriod: string): void {
    const behavior = this.timePeriodBehaviors.get(timePeriod);
    if (behavior) {
      behavior();
    }
  }
}

class HomeEnvironment {
  private objects: Map<string, InteractiveObject>;
  
  setupNowPeriod(): void {
    // Setup basic voice assistant, TV, Roomba, static fridge, etc.
  }
  
  setupNearFuturePeriod(): void {
    // Setup smart screens, AI recipe systems, adaptive lighting, etc.
  }
  
  // Additional setup methods for Mid and Far future
}
```

Implement specific interactions for each time period:
- Now (2025): Voice assistant, TV menu, Roomba, static fridge, manual planning
- Near Future (2030): Smart screens, AI recipes, adaptive lighting, self-driving car
- Mid Future (2040): Cleaner robots, AI companions, adaptive furniture, health pods
- Far Future (2055-2100): Neural interfaces, AI partners, matter manipulation, memory editing

# Test Strategy:
Create user acceptance tests for each interactive element in the home environment. Test the progression of technology across time periods to ensure consistency with the PRD. Perform usability testing to verify intuitive interaction patterns. Test edge cases like rapid switching between time periods.
