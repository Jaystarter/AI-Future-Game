# Task ID: 13
# Title: FAR FUTURE (2055-2100) Workplace Environment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the workplace environment for the 2055-2100 time period with all specified interactions and futuristic AI behaviors.
# Details:
Create the workplace environment for 2055-2100 with all interactive elements mentioned in the PRD:

1. Role selection menu (designer, explorer, mentor)
2. Alien communication console
3. AI planet controller interface
4. Consciousness projection tile
5. Life arc simulation UI
6. Social good influence token system
7. Dream-to-idea generation system
8. Hybrid AI-human NPC mission system
9. Ethical planetary weather control interface
10. Inner growth skill tree

Each interactive element should implement the IInteractable interface and provide appropriate responses. The environment should reflect the futuristic AI capabilities in workplace settings circa 2055-2100, with systems that transcend traditional work concepts and blend with human consciousness.

Implement appropriate visual design that conveys a far-future workplace with transformative AI integration, consciousness manipulation, and planetary-scale systems.

# Test Strategy:
Test each interactive element individually to ensure it functions as described in the PRD. Verify that interactions feel appropriately advanced for the 2055-2100 time period. Test the complete environment with a player walking through and interacting with all elements in sequence. Compare with earlier workplace environments to ensure a clear progression to transformative AI capabilities is evident.
