Test each interactive element individually to ensure it functions as described in the PRD. Verify that interactions feel appropriately advanced for the 2030 time period. Test the complete environment with a player walking through and interacting with all elements in sequence. Compare with the 2025 workplace to ensure a clear progression in AI capabilities is evident.
