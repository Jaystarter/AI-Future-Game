# Task ID: 14
# Title: Voice Recognition and Command System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a voice recognition and command system for interactions with AI assistants across all time periods.
# Details:
Create a VoiceCommandSystem that handles voice input and recognition for interactions with AI assistants. This system should:

- Capture audio input from the player
- Process and recognize voice commands
- Route commands to appropriate AI systems based on context
- Provide appropriate responses based on the AI capabilities of the current time period

Implementation should include:
```
class VoiceCommandSystem {
  private AudioSource microphoneInput;
  private Dictionary<string, Action<string>> commandHandlers;
  private TimePeriod currentPeriod;
  
  public void Initialize(TimePeriod period);
  public void StartListening();
  public void StopListening();
  public void ProcessCommand(string command);
  public void RegisterCommandHandler(string keyword, Action<string> handler);
  public void UpdateCapabilities(TimePeriod period);
}
```

The system should evolve in capabilities across time periods:
- 2025: Basic command recognition for simple tasks (lights, music)
- 2030: Context-aware commands and natural language understanding
- 2040: Emotional tone recognition and empathetic responses
- 2055-2100: Direct neural interface bypassing verbal communication

Consider using a third-party voice recognition API or simulate voice recognition for development purposes.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests with sample voice commands to verify recognition accuracy. Test the system's ability to route commands to the correct handlers. Verify that the system's capabilities appropriately evolve across time periods. Test edge cases like ambiguous commands or background noise interference.
