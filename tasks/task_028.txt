# Task ID: 28
# Title: Implement Workplace Environment Interactions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 26
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the workplace environment with all interactive elements for each time period, including office tools, communication systems, and AI coworkers that evolve across time periods.
# Details:
Design and implement the workplace environment with interactive elements that demonstrate the evolution of AI in professional settings across the four time periods.

```typescript
class WorkplaceEnvironment {
  private workstations: Map<string, InteractiveObject>;
  private aiCoworkers: Map<string, AICoworker>;
  
  setupNowPeriod(): void {
    // Setup email rewriting, calendar scheduling, spellcheck, Slack, dashboards
  }
  
  setupNearFuturePeriod(): void {
    // Setup AI assistants, auto-summarization, AR meetings, coding assistance
  }
  
  // Additional setup methods for Mid and Far future
}

class AICoworker {
  id: string;
  capabilities: Map<string, AICapability>;
  
  performTask(taskType: string, timePeriod: string): void {
    // Different behavior based on time period and AI advancement
  }
}
```

Implement specific workplace interactions for each time period:
- Now (2025): Email rewriting, calendar scheduling, spellcheck, basic dashboards
- Near Future (2030): AI task assistants, document summarization, AR meetings
- Mid Future (2040): AI co-creators, synthetic coworkers, prompt engineering
- Far Future (2055-2100): Role selection, consciousness transfer, planetary control systems

# Test Strategy:
Create scenario-based tests for workplace interactions in each time period. Verify that AI coworker capabilities properly evolve across time periods. Test the integration between player actions and AI responses in the workplace. Perform load testing to ensure complex workplace simulations run smoothly.
