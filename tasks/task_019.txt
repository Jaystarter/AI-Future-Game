# Task ID: 19
# Title: Tutorial and Guidance System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 17, 18
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a system to provide tutorials and guidance to the player across different time periods.
# Details:
Create a TutorialSystem that provides guidance to the player throughout the game. This system should:

- Introduce new mechanics and interactions as they become available
- Provide context-sensitive help based on player actions
- Scale tutorial complexity based on the time period
- Track which tutorials have been completed

Implementation should include:
```
class TutorialSystem {
  private ProgressSystem progressSystem;
  private UISystem uiSystem;
  private Dictionary<string, TutorialStep> tutorials;
  private Queue<TutorialStep> activeSteps;
  
  public void Initialize(ProgressSystem progressSystem, UISystem uiSystem);
  public void RegisterTutorial(string id, TutorialStep step);
  public void TriggerTutorial(string id);
  public void CompleteTutorialStep(string id);
  public bool IsTutorialComplete(string id);
  public void UpdateActiveTutorials();
}

class TutorialStep {
  public string id;
  public string message;
  public string targetObjectId; // Object this tutorial relates to
  public List<string> prerequisites; // Other tutorials that must be completed first
  
  public void Display(UISystem uiSystem);
  public void Hide();
}
```

Implement tutorials for key interactions in each time period, with appropriate visual styling and presentation methods that match the technological era.

# Test Strategy:
Test tutorial triggering and completion tracking. Verify that prerequisites work correctly. Test that tutorials display appropriately in different contexts. Gather user feedback on tutorial clarity and helpfulness.
