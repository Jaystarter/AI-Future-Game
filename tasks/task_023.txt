# Task ID: 23
# Title: AR/VR Simulation System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a system for AR and VR simulations that become increasingly prevalent in later time periods.
# Details:
Create an ARVRSystem that handles augmented and virtual reality simulations within the game. This system should:

- Provide interfaces for AR overlays and VR environments
- Scale capabilities based on the time period
- Handle transitions between real and virtual spaces
- Simulate different levels of immersion and integration

Implementation should include:
```
class ARVRSystem {
  private TimePeriod currentPeriod;
  private Dictionary<string, ARExperience> arExperiences;
  private Dictionary<string, VRExperience> vrExperiences;
  
  public void Initialize(TimePeriod period);
  public void StartARExperience(string id);
  public void EndARExperience();
  public void StartVRExperience(string id);
  public void EndVRExperience();
  public void UpdateCapabilities(TimePeriod period);
}

class ARExperience {
  private string id;
  private List<GameObject> arObjects; // If using Unity
  
  public void Initialize();
  public void Start();
  public void Update();
  public void End();
}

class VRExperience {
  private string id;
  private Scene vrScene; // If using Unity
  
  public void Initialize();
  public void Start();
  public void Update();
  public void End();
}
```

Implement AR/VR experiences that evolve across time periods:
- 2025: Basic AR apps and separate VR headsets
- 2030: Integrated AR glasses and immersive VR environments
- 2040: Seamless AR/VR blending with physical reality
- 2055-2100: Full consciousness immersion and reality manipulation

# Test Strategy:
Test AR overlay rendering in different environments. Verify VR environment loading and transitions. Test interaction systems within AR/VR experiences. Verify that capabilities appropriately evolve across time periods.
