# Task ID: 20
# Title: Audio System with Evolving Soundscapes
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement an audio system with soundscapes that evolve across time periods to reflect advancing technology.
# Details:
Create an AudioSystem that manages all game audio with evolving soundscapes for each time period. This system should:

- Provide ambient background sounds appropriate to each time period
- Handle sound effects for interactions and events
- Manage music that reflects the technological era
- Transition audio smoothly between time periods and locations

Implementation should include:
```
class AudioSystem {
  private AudioSource ambientSource;
  private AudioSource musicSource;
  private Dictionary<string, AudioClip> soundEffects;
  private Dictionary<TimePeriod, AudioClip> ambientSounds;
  private Dictionary<TimePeriod, AudioClip> musicTracks;
  
  public void Initialize();
  public void PlaySoundEffect(string id, Vector3 position);
  public void UpdateAmbient(TimePeriod period);
  public void UpdateMusic(TimePeriod period);
  public void FadeToAmbient(TimePeriod period, float duration);
  public void FadeToMusic(TimePeriod period, float duration);
}
```

Design soundscapes that evolve across time periods:
- 2025: Familiar digital sounds, notifications, mechanical noises
- 2030: Smoother, more integrated tech sounds, adaptive music
- 2040: Ambient, responsive soundscapes that react to emotions
- 2055-2100: Abstract, consciousness-altering audio experiences

# Test Strategy:
Test audio playback in different environments. Verify that transitions between soundscapes work smoothly. Test spatial audio positioning for sound effects. Gather feedback on whether the audio effectively conveys the technological progression across time periods.
