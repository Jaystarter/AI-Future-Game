# Task ID: 16
# Title: Smart Device Simulation System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a system to simulate smart devices and their evolving capabilities across time periods.
# Details:
Create a SmartDeviceSystem that manages the behavior and functionality of smart devices in the game. This system should:

- Define functionality for different device types (lights, appliances, vehicles)
- Scale capabilities based on the time period
- Handle interactions with the player and other systems
- Simulate connectivity and automation where appropriate

Implementation should include:
```
interface ISmartDevice {
  void Initialize(TimePeriod period);
  void Interact(PlayerController player);
  void UpdateState();
  void UpdateCapabilities(TimePeriod period);
}

class SmartDeviceSystem {
  private Dictionary<string, ISmartDevice> devices;
  private TimePeriod currentPeriod;
  
  public void Initialize(TimePeriod period);
  public void RegisterDevice(string id, ISmartDevice device);
  public ISmartDevice GetDevice(string id);
  public void UpdateAllDevices();
  public void UpdatePeriod(TimePeriod period);
}
```

Implement specific device types with capabilities that evolve across time periods:
- Basic devices (2025): Manual controls with limited automation
- Smart devices (2030): Connected, app-controlled, learning preferences
- Adaptive devices (2040): Emotion-aware, anticipatory, self-maintaining
- Transformative devices (2055-2100): Reality-altering, consciousness-interfacing

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for each device type to verify functionality. Test interactions with the player and other systems. Verify that device capabilities appropriately evolve across time periods. Test edge cases like device failures or unusual usage patterns.
