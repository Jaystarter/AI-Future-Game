# Task ID: 6
# Title: NOW (2025) Home Environment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the home environment for the 2025 time period with all specified interactions and AI behaviors.
# Details:
Create the home environment for 2025 with all interactive elements mentioned in the PRD:

1. Voice assistant for lights/music control
2. TV with scrollable menu and recommendations
3. Phone with social media feed for doomscrolling
4. Roomba robot that can get stuck
5. Static fridge without smart features
6. Calendar UI for manual meal planning
7. Kid NPC that asks about screen time
8. Basic thermostat with preset options
9. Sink that can leak (requires manual repair)
10. Car that requires manual driving

Each interactive element should implement the IInteractable interface and provide appropriate responses. The environment should reflect the limited AI capabilities of 2025.

Implement appropriate visual and audio design that conveys a contemporary home with basic smart home features but limited AI integration.

# Test Strategy:
Test each interactive element individually to ensure it functions as described in the PRD. Verify that interactions feel appropriate for the 2025 time period. Test the complete environment with a player walking through and interacting with all elements in sequence. Gather feedback on whether the environment successfully conveys the intended level of AI advancement.
