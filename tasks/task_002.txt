# Task ID: 2
# Title: Time Period Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a system to manage and transition between the four distinct time periods (2025, 2030, 2040, 2055-2100).
# Details:
Create a TimeManager class that handles the current time period state and transitions between periods. This system should:

- Store the current active time period
- Provide methods to transition between time periods with appropriate visual effects
- Trigger environment changes based on the active time period
- Load appropriate AI behaviors and interactions for each period

Implementation should include:
```
class TimeManager {
  private TimePeriod currentPeriod;
  private Dictionary<TimePeriod, SceneData> periodScenes;
  
  public void Initialize();
  public void TransitionTo(TimePeriod period);
  public TimePeriod GetCurrentPeriod();
  public void RegisterSceneForPeriod(TimePeriod period, SceneData data);
}

enum TimePeriod {
  NOW_2025,
  NEAR_FUTURE_2030,
  MID_FUTURE_2040,
  FAR_FUTURE_2055_2100
}
```

Ensure the system has appropriate events that other systems can subscribe to when time periods change.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for the TimeManager class to verify it correctly manages state transitions. Test that all registered scenes and behaviors are properly activated/deactivated during transitions. Create a simple UI to manually trigger time period changes and verify visual transitions work correctly.
