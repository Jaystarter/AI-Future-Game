# Task ID: 24
# Title: Save/Load System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 18
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a system for saving and loading game state, including player progress and environment state.
# Details:
Create a SaveLoadSystem that handles saving and loading game state. This system should:

- Save player progress, current time period, and location
- Store the state of interactive objects and NPCs
- Handle multiple save slots if needed
- Provide methods for auto-saving and manual saving

Implementation should include:
```
class SaveLoadSystem {
  private ProgressSystem progressSystem;
  private TimeManager timeManager;
  private LocationManager locationManager;
  
  public void Initialize(ProgressSystem progressSystem, TimeManager timeManager, LocationManager locationManager);
  public void SaveGame(int slotIndex);
  public void LoadGame(int slotIndex);
  public bool DoesSaveExist(int slotIndex);
  public void AutoSave();
  public void DeleteSave(int slotIndex);
  
  private SaveData CreateSaveData();
  private void ApplySaveData(SaveData data);
}

class SaveData {
  public TimePeriod currentPeriod;
  public Location currentLocation;
  public Dictionary<string, bool> completedInteractions;
  public Dictionary<TimePeriod, bool> unlockedPeriods;
  public Dictionary<Location, bool> unlockedLocations;
  public Dictionary<string, int> statistics;
  public Dictionary<string, object> objectStates;
  public Dictionary<string, object> npcStates;
}
```

Implement appropriate serialization methods for saving and loading data (JSON, binary serialization, etc.).

# Test Strategy:
Test saving and loading game state across different scenarios. Verify that all relevant state is correctly preserved. Test edge cases like corrupted save data or missing files. Verify compatibility across different game versions if applicable.
