# Task ID: 10
# Title: MID FUTURE (2040) Home Environment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the home environment for the 2040 time period with all specified interactions and highly advanced AI behaviors.
# Details:
Create the home environment for 2040 with all interactive elements mentioned in the PRD:

1. Advanced cleaner robot summoning console
2. Emotionally responsive AI companion
3. Adaptive walls that change color/texture
4. Health pod with AI medical advice
5. Morphing furniture tiles
6. Mood-responsive lighting and audio
7. AI family calendar for chore distribution
8. Dream simulation system
9. AI parenting assistant
10. AR projector for custom learning simulations

Each interactive element should implement the IInteractable interface and provide appropriate responses. The environment should reflect the highly advanced AI capabilities of 2040, with systems that respond to emotional states and provide personalized experiences.

Implement appropriate visual design that conveys a mid-future home with extensive AI integration, adaptive environments, and emotion-aware systems.

# Test Strategy:
Test each interactive element individually to ensure it functions as described in the PRD. Verify that interactions feel appropriately advanced for the 2040 time period. Test the complete environment with a player walking through and interacting with all elements in sequence. Compare with earlier time periods to ensure a clear progression in AI capabilities is evident.
