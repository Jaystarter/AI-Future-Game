Executive Summary
This report presents a comprehensive plan for implementing a Pokémon-style 2D
game that allows players to explore four different time periods representing the
progression of AI technology. The game concept aims to educate players about
how AI might evolve over time through an interactive and engaging medium.
Based on extensive research and analysis, we recommend developing this game
using Unity as the primary game engine, with a modern pixel art style, and a
phased deployment approach targeting PC platforms initially, followed by web
and mobile adaptations.
The game concept effectively communicates the exponential progression of
AI technology by allowing players to physically walk through different time
periods (Present, Near Future, Mid Future, and Far Future), creating a tangible
understanding of how AI might transform society over time.

Technical Implementation
•Unityemerged as the optimal game engine for this project due to its robust
2D support, tilemap system, cross-platform capabilities, and extensive
community resources.
•A tile-based movement system with grid-based navigation provides the
most appropriate foundation for the Pokémon-style gameplay.
•The technical complexity is assessed as Medium-High , primarily due to
the challenges of managing transitions between time periods and imple-
menting period-specific AI behaviors.
•Core technical components should include a tile-based system, charac-
ter controller, dialogue system, time period management, NPC system,
environment interaction system, and save system.
Art Direction
•Modern pixel art is recommended as the primary visual style, offering
nostalgic connection to Pokémon games while enabling efficient production
and clear visual distinction between time periods.
•Each time period should have a distinct color palette and visual language
while maintaining cohesion through consistent character proportions and
design elements.
•A modular approach to asset creation will maximize efficiency by allowing
base assets to evolve across time periods rather than creating everything
from scratch.
Game Mechanics
•The core game loop of explore-interact-solve-progress-discover provides a
solid foundation for engaging gameplay.
•Time period transition mechanics through portal systems allow players to
move between eras to solve puzzles and witness technological evolution.
•AI interaction mechanics should evolve significantly across time periods,
from simple voice assistants in the Present to reality manipulation and
consciousness transfer in the Far Future.
•Puzzle design should leverage the unique capabilities of each time period,
with increasing complexity as players progress.
Development Requirements
•A team of 4-6 people is recommended for a medium-budget approach
(~$100,000-$250,000).
•The estimated development timeline is 10-12 months, including
pre-production, core development, content creation, and polish phases.
•A phased development approach starting with a prototype and vertical
slice is recommended to validate the concept before full production.
